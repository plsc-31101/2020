# Programming in R

This unit covers some more advanced programming in R - namely:

1. [Conditional Flow]
2. [Functions]
3. [Iteration]

Mastering these skills will make you virtually invincible in R!

Note that these concepts are __not specific to R__. While the syntax might vary, the basic idea of flow, functions, and iteration are common across all scripting languages. So if you ever think of picking up Python or something else, it's critical to familiarize yourself with these concepts.

## Conditional Flow 

Sometimes you only want to execute code if a certain condition is met. To do that, we use an **if-else statement.** It looks like this:

```{r eval = F}
if (condition) {
  # code executed when condition is TRUE
} else {
  # code executed when condition is FALSE
}
```

`condition` is a statement that must always evaluate to either `TRUE` or `FALSE`. This is similar to `filter()`, except `condition` can only be a single value (i.e. a vector of length 1), whereas `filter()` works for entire vectors (or columns).

Let's look at a simple example:

```{r}
age = 84
if (age > 60) {
    print("OK Boomer")
} else {
    print("But you don't look like a professor!")
}
```

We refer to the first `print` command as the first *branch*. 

Let's change the `age` variable to execute the second branch:

```{r}
age = 20
if (age > 60) {
    print("OK Boomer")
} else {
    print("But you don't look like a professor!")
}
```

### Multiple Conditions

You can chain conditional statements together:

```{r eval = F}
if (this) {
  # do that
} else if (that) {
  # do something else
} else {
  # do something completely different
}
```

### Complex Statements

We can generate more complex conditional statements with boolean operators like `&` and `|`:

```{r}
age = 45 

if (age > 60) {
    print("OK Boomer")
} else if (age < 60 & age > 40) {
    print("How's the midlife crisis?")
} else {
    print("But you don't look like a professor!")
}
```

### Code Style

Both `if` and `function` should (almost) always be followed by squiggly brackets (`{}`), and the contents should be indented. This makes it easier to see the hierarchy in your code by skimming the left-hand margin.

An opening curly brace should never go on its own line and should always be followed by a new line. A closing curly brace should always go on its own line, unless itâ€™s followed by else. Always indent the code inside curly braces.

```{r eval=F}
# Bad
if (y < 0 && debug)
message("Y is negative")

if (y == 0) {
  log(x)
} 
else {
  y ^ x
}

# Good
if (y < 0 && debug) {
  message("Y is negative")
}

if (y == 0) {
  log(x)
} else {
  y ^ x
}
```

### `if` vs. `if_else`

Because if-else conditional statements like the ones outlined above must always resolve to a single `TRUE` or `FALSE`, they cannot be used for vector operations. Vector operations are where you make multiple comparisons simultaneously for each value stored inside a vector. 

Consider the `gapminder` data and imagine you wanted to create a new column identifying whether or not a country-year observation has a life expectancy of at least 35.

```{r}
gap <- read.csv("Data/gapminder-FiveYearData.csv")
head(gap)
```

This sounds like a classic if-else operation. For each observation, if `lifeExp` is greater than or equal to `35`, then the value in the new column should be `1`. Otherwise, it should be `0`. But what happens if we try to implement this using an if-else operation like above?

```{r}
gap_if <- gap %>%
   mutate(life.35 = if(lifeExp >= 35){
     1
   } else {
     0
   })

head(gap_if)
```

This did not work correctly. Because `if()` can only handle a single `TRUE/FALSE` value, it only checked the first row of the data frame. That row contained `28.801`, so it generated a vector of length 1704 with each value being `0`.

Because we in fact want to make this if-else comparison 1704 times, we should instead use **`if_else()`**. This **vectorizes** the if-else comparison and makes a separate comparison for each row of the data frame. This allows us to correctly generate this new column.

```{r}
gap_ifelse <- gap %>%
  mutate(life.35 = if_else(lifeExp >= 35, 1, 0))

head(gap_ifelse)
```
