# Plotting

> "Make it informative, then make it pretty"

There are two major sets of tools for creating plots in R:

* 1. [base](#1-r-base-graphics), which come with all R installations. 
* 2. [ggplot2](#2-ggplot2), a stand-alone package.  

Note that other plotting facilities do exist (notably **lattice**), but base and `ggplot2` are by far the most popular. 

## The Dataset

For the following examples, we will be using the gapminder dataset we've used previously. Gapminder is a country-year dataset with information on life expectancy, among other things.

```{r}
gap <- read.csv("data/gapminder-FiveYearData.csv", stringsAsFactors = F)
```

## R Base Graphics

The **basic** call takes the following form:

```{r, eval=F}
plot(x=, y=)
```
```{r}
plot(x = gap$gdpPercap, y = gap$lifeExp)
```

### Scatter and Line Plots

The "type" argument accepts the following character indicators.

* "p" -- point/scatter plots (default plotting behavior)

```{r, fig.cap=" "}
plot(x = gap$gdpPercap, y = gap$lifeExp, type="p")
```

* "l" -- line graphs

```{r, fig.cap=" "}
# Note that "line" does not create a smoothing line, just connected points
plot(x = gap$gdpPercap, y = gap$lifeExp, type="l") 
```

* "b" -- both line and point plots

```{r, fig.cap=" "}
plot(x = gap$gdpPercap, y = gap$lifeExp, type="b") 
```

### Histograms and Density Plots

Histograms display the frequency of different values of a variable.

```{r}
hist(x=gap$lifeExp)
```

Histograms require a `breaks` argument, which determine the number of bins in the plot. Let's play around with different `breaks` values.

```{r}
hist(x=gap$lifeExp, breaks=5)
hist(x=gap$lifeExp, breaks=10)
```

Density plots are similar, they visualize the distribution of data over a continuous interval. 

```{r, fig.cap=" "}
# Create a density object (NOTE: be sure to remove missing values)
age.density <- density(x=gap$lifeExp, na.rm=T)

# Plot the density object
plot(x=age.density)
```

Density passes a `bw` parameter, which determins the plot's "bandwidth". 

```{r}
# Plot the density object, bandwidth of 0.5
plot(x=density(x=gap$lifeExp, bw=.5))
# Plot the density object, bandwidth of 2
plot(x=density(x=gap$lifeExp, bw=2))
# Plot the density object, bandwidth of 6
plot(x=density(x=gap$lifeExp, bw=6)) 
```

### Labels

Here's the basic call with popular labeling arguments:

```{r, eval=F}
plot(x=, y=, type="", xlab="", ylab="", main="") 
```

From the previous example...

```{r, fig.cap=" "}
plot(x = gap$gdpPercap, y = gap$lifeExp, type="p", xlab="GDP per cap", ylab="Life Expectancy", main="Life Expectancy ~ GDP") # Add labels for axes and overall plot
```

### Axis and Size Scaling

Currently itâ€™s hard to see the relationship between the points due to some strong outliers in GDP per capita. We can change the scale of units on the x-axis using scaling arguments.

Here's the basic call with popular scaling arguments

```{r, eval=F}
plot(x=, y=, type="", xlim=, ylim=, cex=)
```

From the previous example...

```{r, fig.cap=" "}
# Create a basic plot
plot(x = gap$gdpPercap, y = gap$lifeExp, type="p")
# Limit gdp (x-axis) to between 1,000 and 20,000
plot(x = gap$gdpPercap, y = gap$lifeExp, xlim = c(1000,20000)) 
# Limit gdp (x-axis) to between 1,000 and 20,000, increase point size to 2
plot(x = gap$gdpPercap, y = gap$lifeExp, xlim = c(1000,20000), cex=2) 
# Limit gdp (x-axis) to between 1,000 and 20,000, decrease point size to 0.5
plot(x = gap$gdpPercap, y = gap$lifeExp, xlim = c(1000,20000), cex=0.5)  
```

### Graphical Parameters

We can change the points with a number of graphical options:

```{r, eval=F}
plot(x=, y=, type="", col="", pch=, lty=, lwd=)
```

* Colors

```{r}
colors()[1:20] # View first 20 elements of the color vector
colors()[179] # View specific element of the color vector
```

Another option: [R Color Infographic](http://research.stowers-institute.org/efg/R/Color/Chart/ColorsChart1.jpg)
```{r, fig.cap=" "}
plot(x = gap$gdpPercap, y = gap$lifeExp, type="p", col=colors()[145]) # or col="gold3"
plot(x = gap$gdpPercap, y = gap$lifeExp, type="p", col="seagreen4") # or col=colors()[578]
```

* Point Styles and Widths

[A Good Reference](http://www.endmemo.com/program/R/pic/pchsymbols.png)

```{r, fig.cap=" "}
# Change point style to crosses
plot(x = gap$gdpPercap, y = gap$lifeExp, type="p", pch=3) 
# Change point style to filled squares
plot(x = gap$gdpPercap, y = gap$lifeExp, type="p",pch=15) 
# Change point style to filled squares and increase point size to 3
plot(x = gap$gdpPercap, y = gap$lifeExp, type="p",pch=15, cex=3) 
# Change point style to "w"
plot(x = gap$gdpPercap, y = gap$lifeExp, type="p", pch="w")
# Change point style to "$" and increase point size to 2
plot(x = gap$gdpPercap, y = gap$lifeExp, type="p",pch="$", cex=2) 
```

* Line Styles and Widths

```{r, fig.cap=" "}
# Line plot with solid line
plot(x = gap$gdpPercap, y = gap$lifeExp, type="l", lty=1)
# Line plot with medium dashed line
plot(x = gap$gdpPercap, y = gap$lifeExp, type="l", lty=2)
# Line plot with short dashed line
plot(x = gap$gdpPercap, y = gap$lifeExp, type="l", lty=3)
# Change line width to 2
plot(x = gap$gdpPercap, y = gap$lifeExp, type="l", lty=3, lwd=2)
# Change line width to 5
plot(x = gap$gdpPercap, y = gap$lifeExp, type="l",  lwd=5)
# Change line width to 10 and use dash-dot
plot(x = gap$gdpPercap, y = gap$lifeExp, type="l",  lty=4, lwd=10)
```

### Annotations, Reference Lines, and Legends

* Text

We can add text to an arbitrary point on the graph like this:

```{r, fig.cap=" "}
# plot the line first
plot(x = gap$gdpPercap, y = gap$lifeExp, type="p")
# now add the label
text(x=40000, y=50, labels="Evens Out", cex = .75)
```

We can also add labels for every point by passing in a vector of text:

```{r, fig.cap=" "}
# first randomly select rows for a smaller gapaset
library(dplyr)
small <- gap %>% sample_n(100)

# plot the line first
plot(x = small$gdpPercap, y = small$lifeExp, type="p")
# now add the label
text(x = small$gdpPercap, y = small$lifeExp, labels = small$country)
```

* Reference Lines

```{r, fig.cap=" "}
# plot the line
plot(x = gap$gdpPercap, y = gap$lifeExp, type="p")
# now the guides
abline(v=40000, h=75, lty=2)
```
