## Factors

Factors are special vectors that represent _categorical_ data: variables that have a fixed and known set of possible values. Think: Democrat, Republican, Independent; Male, Female, Other; etc.

It is important that R knows whether it is dealing with a continuous or a categorical variable, as the statistical models you will develop in the future treat both types differently. 

Historically, factors were much easier to work with than characters. As a result, many of the functions in base R automatically convert characters to factors. This means that factors often pop up in places where theyâ€™re not actually helpful.

### Creating Factors

To create factors in R, you use the function `factor()`. The first thing that you have to do is create a vector that contains all the observations that belong to a limited number of categories. For example, `party_vector` contains the partyID of 5 different individuals:

```{r}
party_vector <- c("Rep", "Rep", "Dem", "Rep", "Dem")
```

It is clear that there are two categories, or in R-terms __factor levels__, at work here: `Dem` and `Rep`.

The function `factor()` will encode the vector as a factor:

```{r}
party_factor <- factor(party_vector)
party_vector
party_factor
```

### Summarizing a Factor

One of your favorite functions in R will be `summary()`. This will give you a quick overview of the contents of a variable. Let's compare using `summary()` on both the character vector and the factor:

```{r}
summary(party_vector)
summary(party_factor)
```

### Changing Factor Levels

When you create the factor, the factor levels are set to specific values. We can access those values with the `levels()` function. 

```{r}
levels(party_factor)
```

Any values _not_ in the set of levels will be silently converted to `NA`. Let's say we want to add an Independent to our sample:

```{r}
party_factor[5] <- "Ind"
party_factor
```

We first need to add "Ind" to our factor levels. This will allow us to add Independents to our sample:

```{r}
levels(party_factor)
levels(party_factor) <- c("Dem", "Rep", "Ind")

party_factor[5] <- "Ind"
party_factor
```

### Factors are Integers

Factors are pretty much integers that have labels on them. Underneath, it's really numbers (1, 2, 3...). 

```{r}
str(party_factor)
```

They are better than using simple integer labels because factors are self-describing. For example, `democrat` and `republican` are more descriptive than `1`s and `2`s. 

However, **factors are NOT characters!!**

While factors look (and often behave) like character vectors, they are actually integers. Be careful when treating them like strings. 

```{r}
x <- c("a", "b", "b", "a")
x <- as.factor(x)
c(x, "c")
```

For this reason, it's usually best to explicitly **convert** factors to character vectors if you need string-like behaviour. 

```{r}
x <- c("a", "b", "b", "a")
x <- as.factor(x)
x <- as.character(x)
c(x, "c'")
```

### Challenges

#### Challenge 1.  {-}

What happens to a factor when you modify its levels?
    
```{r, results = "none"}
f1 <- factor(letters)
levels(f1) <- rev(levels(f1))
f1
```

#### Challenge 2.  {-}

What does this code do? How do `f2` and `f3` differ from `f1`? 

```{r, results = "none"}
f2 <- rev(factor(letters))
f3 <- factor(letters, levels = rev(letters))
```
