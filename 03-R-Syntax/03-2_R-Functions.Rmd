## Functions

R has a large collection of built-in functions that helps us do things. When we use a function, we say we are _calling_ a function.

```{r eval=F}
function_name(arg1 = val1, arg2 = val2, ...)
```

Here are some helpful built-in functions:

```{r}
my_var <- c(1, 5, 2, 4, 5)

sum(my_var)
length(my_var)
min(my_var)
max(my_var)
unique(my_var)
```

### Arguments

An *argument* is a value that is *passed* into a function. Every function returns a *result*.

Let’s try using `seq()`, which makes regular sequences of numbers. While we are at it, we will learn more helpful features of RStudio. 

Type `se` and hit TAB. A popup shows you possible completions. Specify `seq()` by typing more (a "q") to disambiguate, or by using ↑/↓ arrows to select. Notice the floating tooltip that pops up, reminding you of the function’s arguments and purpose. 

Press TAB once more when you have selected the function you want. RStudio will add matching opening (`(`) and closing (`)`) parentheses for you. Type the arguments `1, 10` and hit return.

```{r}
seq(1, 10)
```

How many arguments did we pass into the `seq` function?

### Store Function Output

Notice that, when we called the `seq` function, nothing changed in our environment. That is because we did not save our results to an object. Let's try it again by assigning a variable:

```{r}
y <- seq(1, 10)
y
```

### Argument Restrictions and Defaults

Let's use another function, called `round`:

```{r}
round(60.123)
```

`round` must be given at least one argument. Moreover, it must be given things that can be meaningfully rounded.

```{r eval = F}
round()
round('a')
```

Functions may have __default__ values for some arguments.

By default, `round` will round off any number to zero decimal places. But we can specify the number of decimal places we want.

```{r}
round(60.123)
round(60.123, digits = 2)
round(60.123, 2)
```

### Documentation and Help Files

How do we know what kinds of arguments to pass into a function? Every built-in function comes with ___documentation__.

* `?` + object opens a help page for that specific object.
* `??` + object searches help pages containing the name of the object.

```{r, eval = FALSE}
?mean
??mean
```

All help files are structured the same way:

* The __Arguments__ section tells us exactly what kind of information we can pass into a function.
* The __Value__ section explains what the output of the function is.
* The __Examples__ section contains real examples of the function in use.

### Challenges

#### Challenge 1: What Happens When {-}

Explain, in simple terms, the order of operations in the following program: when does the addition happen, when does the subtraction happen, when is each function called, etc.

What is the final value of `radiance`?

```{r}
radiance <- 1.0
radiance <- max(2.1, 2.0 + min(radiance, 1.1 * radiance - 0.5))
```

#### Challenge 2: Why? {-}

Run the following code.

```{r eval = F}
rich <- "gold"
poor <- "tin"
max(rich, poor)
```

Using the help files for `max`, explain why it returns the result it does.
