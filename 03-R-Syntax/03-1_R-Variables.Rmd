# R Syntax

Frustration is natural when you start programming in R. R is a stickler for punctuation, and even one character out of place will cause it to complain. But while you should expect to be a little frustrated, take comfort in that it is both typical and temporary: it happens to everyone, and the only way to get over it is to keep trying.

## Variables

### Arithmetic

In its most basic form, R can be used as a simple calculator. Consider the following arithmetic operators:

- Addition: `+`
- Subtraction: `-`
- Multiplication: `*`
- Division: `/`
- Exponentiation: `^`
- Modulo (remainder): `%%`

```{r}
1 / 200 * 30
(59 + 73 + 2) / 3
5 %% 2
```

But when we do this, none of our results are saved for later use.

### Assigning Variables

An essential part of programming is creating objects (or variables).^[Technically, objects and variables are different things, but we will use the two interchangeably for now.] Variables are names for values. 

A variable is created when a value is assigned to it. We do that with `<-`.

```{r}
x <- 3
```

`<-` is called the *assignment operator*. It assigns values on the right to objects on the left, like this:

```{r eval = F}
object_name <- value
```

So, after executing `x <- 3`, the value of `x` is `3`. The arrow can be read as 3 goes into `x`. 

**NB**: Do not use `=` for assignments. It will work in some contexts, but it will cause confusion later. There will be other scenarios where you will use `=` - we will discuss these later on.

We can use variables in calculations just as if they were values.

```{r}
x <- 3
x + 5
``` 

#### Inspect objects to display values. {-}

In R, the contents of an object can be printed by simply executing the object name.

```{r}
x <- 3
x
```

#### Whitespace makes code easier to read. {-}

Notice that we surrounded `<-` with spaces. In `R`, white space is ignored (unlike Python). It is good practice to use spaces, because it makes code easier to read.

```{r}
experiment<-"current vs. voltage"   # this is bad
experiment <- "current vs. voltage" # this is better
```

### Variable Names

Object names can only contain letters, numbers, `_` and `.`. 

You want your object names to be descriptive. `x` is not a good variable name (sorry!). You will also need a convention for multiple words. I recommend *snake_case*, where you separate lowercase words with `_`.

```{r eval = F}
i_use_snake_case
otherPeopleUseCamelCase
some.people.use.periods
And_aFew.People_RENOUNCEconvention
```

Let's make an assignment using snake_case:

```{r}
r_rocks <- 2 ^ 3
```

And let's try to inspect it:

```{r, error = TRUE}
r_rock
R_rocks
```

R is case-sensitive!

#### Use the TAB key to autocomplete. {-}

Because typos are the absolute worst, we can use R Studio to help us type. Let's inspect `r_rocks` using RStudioâ€™s tab completion facility. Type "r_", press TAB, add characters until you have a unique prefix, then press return.

```{r}
r_rocks
```

### Challenges

#### Challenge 1: Making and Printing Variables {-}

Make 3 variables: name (with your full name), city (where you were born), and year (when you were born).

#### Challenge 2: Swapping Values {-}

Draw a table showing the values of the variables in this program after each statement is executed.

In simple terms, what do the last three lines of this program do?

```{r}
lowest <- 1.0
highest <- 3.0
temp <- lowest
lowest <- highest
highest <- temp
```

#### Challenge 3: Predicting Values {-}

What is the final value of `position` in the program below? Try to predict the value without running the program, then check your prediction.

```{r}
initial <- "left"
position <- initial
initial <- "right"
```

#### Challenge 4: Syntax {-}

Why does the following code fail?

```{r eval = F}
age == 31
```

And the following?

```{r eval = F}
31 <-  age
```
